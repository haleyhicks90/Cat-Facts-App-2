Cat Facts App

Cat Facts App is a simple web application designed and built with the user's love for cats in mind.

This application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

We wanted to provide the user with a simple, intuitive experience with the outcome of gaining valuable cat knowledge, as well as blissful scrolling through our carefully selected collection of internet cat pics.

The user will simply type the number of cat facts they wish to read, press the submit button, and enjoy!

Issues to solve:
    1. Centering the buttons of our cat pic carousel
    2. Centering the cat images in their container
